<h1><em>Metro</em></h1>
<p>You enter through the gates and descend the stairs. Walk with your head low and your hands buried. You wait for the echoing tumult of a beast approaching. It is piercing. Like metal against metal against the tunnel&nbsp;walls. </p>
<p>You have heard all of this before.</p>
<p>In your peripherals you see the animal, the train, slowing down before you.&nbsp;It speaks to you, hisses, then achingly open its doors. You run to them. </p>
<p>Inside you do not know where to sit. Two anxious friends will always sit near the door. Three will stand by it. You are alone, you take a seat in the squares of chairs between the doors and sit diagonally from someone else. In front of you is a theater of people and to your left is your neighbor, expressionless but curious. Waiting.</p>
<p>You close your eyes. Sirens play the fanfare for the closing doors. You hear the drone of an old man, a young girl whimpering at the train car&rsquo;s end,&nbsp;the rush of air, the ruffling of a plastic bag,&nbsp;the screech of metal, the scuffing of shoes. Running through the tunnel you hear it all as a some odd choir and the rhythm hits you when you nearly collide with the passing train.</p>
<p>You have the sensation of being watched. You see it all as some game and try to hold yourself uninterrupted. But you look back. For two very long seconds you look into the eyes of someone you will never know. </p>
<p>The doors break themselves open. File in, file out. Get out, go down, walk up the stairs two steps at a time. Wave at the accordion player, give at least a hello to the beggars, round the corners, waft away the smells of urine. Get on the one, get on the four. Packed. A spate of hands tie themselves to the center bar of a train cart. The m&eacute;tro&nbsp;pumps blood into Paris. </p>
<p>You figure it must be after work because it&rsquo;s a chatter box now. Can you decipher it? You pick out a few words, a pair of eyes; you ask who is with who here? And where are they going? </p>
<p>You get off at your final stop and approach the mouth of the <em>sortie</em>. You stand for a few lifelong moments thinking about Ezra Pound&rsquo;s <a href='http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bartleby.com%2F104%2F106.html&t=ZTlhYmEwZWY0MmU0NzcyNDNmMjM4NjQ3Y2QyMzAyYjk0ZGQxNjU0MCx1TFRQZUNacw%3D%3D' target='_blank'>poem</a>. </p>
<p>In daylight, in some square, in some park, in some cell of Paris you hear music fill you. Blues, opera, jazz, gypsie, eastern; washboards, didgeridoos, guitars, kick drums, clarinets. It halts you. It moves you. it pushes you from street to street.</p>
<p>You think of sound and you think of music and you can not always tell the difference. </p>
<p>You reenter the m&eacute;tro. You start and your day here, awaiting the tumult. It is all orchestrating. You are heading home, or you think that you already have.</p></body>
