<h1><em>I Was Born in (and Left) the USA</em></h1>
<p>In October I said I was going to go back to France.</p>
<p>In January I applied. </p>
<p>In February, March, April and May I waited until the news came through. </p>
<p>In June, a weekend in Chicago: visa, birth certificate, banking, house-hunting, working between Midland and Lansing. Waiting. </p>
<p>In August I handed over the lease. Moved out of the room. Moved from couch to floor to couch. Work, work, work. Wait, wait, wait, and hear people say, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to find some French girl.&quot; </p>
<p>September came, but moved slowly; in complete exhaustion of my patience I found myself pushing through the next few days in the States with a one-way ticket, one week of accommodation with a friend of an ex-professor, packing and playing <em>Midnight in Paris</em> on repeat. </p>
<p>At the airport terminal, we, the other college student, the businessman, the L.A. mother and myself, discovered that American Airlines does not keep track of their flights very well. </p>
<p>Ran to the connecting flight in O&apos;Hare. Took a sleepless flight to Paris where the mother from Ghana and I pointed out the faux pas of AA: &quot;I&rsquo;m flying United next time,&rdquo; she said. </p>
<p>Airport, customs, passport/visa stamped, 50 pounds of luggage; then in RER B a man with a disintegrating violin and his daughter (on the tambourine) played a gypsy tune and for the first time since the last time I was in France I felt like I was in France for the first time again&ndash;so, yeah, I gave them one Euro.  </p>
<p>Took RER D with specific instructions not to get off at the first stop. Got off at the first stop because we could not stop at the second stop. Where to go? &ldquo;Monsieur! Prennez le bus.&rdquo; So I took the bus. </p>
<p>Got off in Saint-Denis where a flood of foreigners traversed the streets in completely random but straight lines, always nearing a collision but never quite colliding, always passing through but not passively. </p>
<p>Down the street to the theater to the convent to the boulangerie. &ldquo;The very tall, pink building,&rdquo; said the e-mail. </p>
<p>I buzzed the buzzer on the name of my one-week-long host. It buzzed back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello?&quot; </p>
<p>No answer. </p>
<p>Opened the door and find the mailbox with the name and the number, 27. Perfect. I got into the elevator to find the second floor&ndash;the buttons are labeled: 3, 5, 7, 9, etc. Got out of the elevator. Went back outside, rebuzzed, it rebuzzed back.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No answer. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Merde.&quot; </p>
<p>I went back inside and to my relief a head poked itself out of the doorway of the stairwell and said: &quot;Andy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thank the lord. <em>Here&rsquo;s your room, here&rsquo;s the shower, here are my good friends who by the way are college professors</em>. Turned my French on. Mostly listened. </p>
<p>I am staying with someone named C&eacute;line. Due to my exhaustion, the names of her friends, a woman and her boyfriend, escaped me. They talked and I listened: <em>the things we don&rsquo;t know about our digestive system; my favorite rugby teams are the ones who lose; in France we call herbal tea </em>pisse m&eacute;m&eacute;<em>, granny&rsquo;s piss;</em><em> children&rsquo;s books are so full of kindness. </em>Things like that. <em><br /></em></p>
<p>The man had a huge beard and while we were eating hamburgers (that&apos;s <em>am-buh-gur</em>), food fell in it so C&eacute;line read out loud a book where this happens to a homeless man. There were pictures. </p>
<p>Then she showed me around Saint-Denis (a suburb just north of Paris): over 160 nationalities live here. You&rsquo;re not a minority because everyone in Saint-Denis is.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m sitting at a small table in small flat in a suburb just north of Paris, edges from the beginning of October and a new job and I&rsquo;m wondering what it all was that got me here. </p>
<p>My second journey with France has started and we&rsquo;ve got a long way to go. </p> </body>
