<h1><em>Paris, My New Girlfriend</em></h1>
<p>We fell in love during one of those lazy afternoons in June.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a clich&eacute; story: I could not keep my eyes off of her, all of my friends wondered where I went on the weekends; it was our secret. Like all good love stories, however, our time together ended with a stale goodbye. I had to go back home. <em>Oh, Paris!</em> I would lament on those frigid winter days in Michigan amongst loud eye rolls from my friends and family, <em>when will I ever see you again?</em></p>
<p>Now that I am back on her streets, riding her subway trains, and consuming her baguettes without end, I could not be happier. But like all relationships, Paris and I do not always see eye to eye.</p>
<p>Like any grid-system-raised American, I expect roads to at least somewhat follow cardinal directions. You know, this road goes north, that road goes west&mdash;maybe one going northwest to southeast if you&rsquo;re feeling up to it&mdash;but no, she just has roads, winding, beautiful, completely irrational roads. If you look at Paris from areal view, you would think the design was modeled after a pile of criss-crossing sticks. Being disoriented has its charm, but not when you&rsquo;re running late to work. P.S. the <em>rue de Clichy</em> is not the <em>avenue de Clichy</em> nor the <em>boulevard de Clichy</em>, but they are all next to each other.</p>
<p>But, then again, who doesn&rsquo;t like getting lost in Paris? When night falls, you forget about having any sense of direction, and lose yourself in the vastness of the city, the streets radiate under the powdery, blushing glow of gold.</p>
<p>You might turn a corner and find of flood of restaurant-goers: the rush of voices, the smell of fresh bread, the owners barking, <em>Monsieur!,</em> at you, everyone so close together it feels like the towering walls around them are slowly colliding. You might turn another corner and find nothing in particular, just some glorified alleyway named <em>the Fishing Cat street</em>. You might find a chapel, and you might find scaling street art of a man shushing you with a middle finger.</p>
<p>Paris is full of contradictions like that. Three people might walk up to a bar (after having ordered some beer), ask for three glasses of water, the bartender might only give them two, they will ask where the third glass is and the bartender might say it is located somewhere in the bathroom. She looks her best during the night time, but during the day she is almost entirely gray and cloudy, even dismal.</p>
<p>Paris refuses to answer my questions most times. Like how do Parisians survive when all they drink is coffee and juice? What&rsquo;s so bad about tap water, and what is in the food and the cigarettes that makes everyone so damn attractive?</p>
<p>But mostly, Paris makes me abandon my priorities. If you are like me and you are somewhere you really love, you&rsquo;ll forget to eat, drink enough water, fill out immigration forms, or look for housing as desperately as you need to. Love makes you stupid, I guess. There is a time to worry, sure, but you must also find that place where an inexplicable calm comes over you.</p>
<p>For me it&rsquo;s in Montmatre.</p>
<p>Montmatre is an area known by many tourists as the homestead of Sacr&eacute;-C&oelig;ur, but there is a way of life away from that in the finer workings of that hilly neighborhood. In the more discreet rues and passages up, down, and across Montmarte, you are as likely to turn a corner and run into a street that has come to life with jazz and the buzz of late-night french conversation as you are to turn another and walk right into a small shop selling nothing in particular, just things of interests: wooden hands, candlesticks, old paintings and maps, chandeliers, and others you can not imagine.</p>
<p>Montmatre knows me to come alone. I have been spending a lot of time by myself, and I am actually quite thankful for it. Though I love people and my friends and family, there is something to being anonymous for a while. Like anywhere else on the planet, there is a relationship to develop. Paris is just as much a living thing as you or me or East Lansing or Midland; I think this is what draws me to being alone with the city. Before I can do anything else, I have to understand how she works.</p></body>
